### **Detect a Cycle in an Undirected Graph Using DFS**

This teaches the basic concept of detecting cycles with DFS, before we add recursion stack logic for directed graphs.

---

## **Problem Statement**

You are given an **undirected graph** with `n` nodes labeled `0` to `n-1`, represented as an adjacency list.

Write a function in Java:

```java
boolean hasCycle(int n, List<List<Integer>> adj)
```

Return:

* `true` → if the graph contains at least one cycle
* `false` → otherwise

Use **recursive DFS**.

---

## **Details**

* The graph may be **disconnected** (you must handle all components)
* No self-loops or duplicate edges
* You must detect cycles using the rule:

  > In an undirected graph, a cycle exists if you visit an already visited node **that is not the parent**.

## **Example 1**

**Input:**

```
n = 3
adj = [
  [1],
  [0, 2],
  [1]
]
```

**Output:**

```
false
```

Explanation: This is a simple chain: 0–1–2. No cycle.

---

## **Example 2**

**Input:**

```
n = 3
adj = [
  [1, 2],
  [0, 2],
  [0, 1]
]
```

**Output:**

```
true
```

Explanation: This forms a triangle cycle: 0–1–2–0.
