### methods
#### set intersection
- turn both arrays into sets
- check the elements that are in both
- return an array containing those elements </br>
  time complexity: $O(m + n)$ -- space complexity $O(m + n)$

#### sorting and two pointers
#### hash map and count frequency
#### single set
  time complexity: $O(m + n)$ -- space complexity $O(m + n)$
#### nested loops (brute force)
