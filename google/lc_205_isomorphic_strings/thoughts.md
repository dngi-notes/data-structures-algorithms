- map characters in `s` to the characters in `t`
  e.g. in s = "egg", t = "add"
  e:a, g:d
  `map.put(c1, c2)`


  in the case of example1

  map.put(c1, c2) *mapping the two together*
  - use a hashmap to check for correct key assignments
  - use a hashset to see if the value has been assigned already
