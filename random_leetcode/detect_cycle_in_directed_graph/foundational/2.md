# 🔹 **Building Block Problem (Easy): Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph – Basic Version**

This introduces **directed edges** and the idea of **tracking nodes in the recursion stack**, but we’ll keep it small and controlled.

---

## **Problem Statement**

You are given a **directed graph** with `n` nodes labeled `0` to `n-1`, represented as an adjacency list.

Write a function in Java:

```java
boolean hasDirectedCycle(int n, List<List<Integer>> adj)
```

Return:

* `true` → if the graph contains at least one cycle
* `false` → otherwise

**Simplifications for this problem:**

* The graph is **connected** (only one component)
* `n` ≤ 10 (so performance is not an issue)
* You must still use **DFS**
* Introduce a **recursion stack tracking** (but don’t worry about multiple disconnected components yet)

## **Example 1**

**Input:**

```
n = 3
adj = [
  [1],
  [2],
  []
]
```

**Output:**

```
false
```

Explanation: 0 → 1 → 2, no cycles.

---

## **Example 2**

**Input:**

```
n = 3
adj = [
  [1],
  [2],
  [0]
]
```

**Output:**

```
true
```

Explanation: 0 → 1 → 2 → 0 forms a cycle.

## **Hints / Guidance**

* Use a **visited array** to track nodes already fully processed
* Use a **recursion stack (or boolean array)** to track nodes in the current DFS path
* If during DFS you reach a node that is **already in the recursion stack**, a cycle exists
